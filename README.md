# Dive Computers simulator

**English** | [Français](README.fr.md)

Educational dive computer simulator. You steer a diver in the water column and watch, in real time and side by side, how different dive computers react: NDL, stops, ascent rate, alarms, tissue loading, gas consumption, oxygen toxicity.

User interface in English and French, metric or imperial units.

> [!WARNING]
> **Educational tool only. Never use it to plan or conduct a real dive.**
> Calculations are approximations and may differ significantly from those of a real dive computer. Always follow your training, your tables and your equipment manufacturer's instructions.

## Simulated computers

| Model | Algorithm | Fidelity |

Proprietary algorithms (RGBM, ZH-L16 ADT MB, Pelagic Z+) are unpublished: they are approximated from Bühlmann ZHL-16C with gradient factors and penalties calibrated on published values. The Aqualung i330R states Bühlmann ZHL-16C + GF but departs from it in an undocumented way: it runs here with its published gradient factors, marked ≈. Likewise the Azoth Systems Odyssey adds an unpublished penalty to repetitive dives: its first dive is plain Bühlmann + GF, the following ones are not penalised here. Displays and rules (alarms, stops, lockouts…) are inspired by each model's public user manual.

In the app, a notice is shown on every visit (educational use, approximated algorithms, no affiliation), and a ✓ / ≈ caption above each computer reminds you that it is an unofficial interpretation. In the Compare tab, the stop depth and time and the TTS of the ≈ computers are not shown during decompression (only "Stop required", with the unverified extrapolated estimate on hover): only their no-deco limit is calibrated on published values, so compare how they react, not the minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> **The displays are interpretations, not reproductions.** They are inspired by the listed models and may differ from them in many ways: layout, colours, fonts, texts, menus, behaviour, alarms, available settings or computed values. Only part of each device's modes and features is simulated, and manufacturers may update their products (firmware, display) without this simulator being updated. When in doubt, the official manual and the real device prevail.

## Getting started

Requirements: Node.js 18 or later.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # Vite development server
npm run build     # TypeScript check + production build in dist/
npm run preview   # serves the production build
```

Command-line analysis scripts:

```bash
npm run calib     # NDL tables by depth and GF (calibration)
npm run scenario  # replays a dive profile on every computer
npm run stops     # checks each computer's behaviour at deco stops
```

## Controls

- Tap or click (and drag) in the water, or use the mouse wheel, to go to a depth (at the last chosen speed; 9 m/min ascending and 18 m/min descending by default).
- ▲ / ▼ (buttons or arrow keys) to set the ascent or descent speed in 1 m/min steps; ■ or `0` to hold depth.
- Pause and time speed (×1 to ×300) in the bar under the water column (or 3D view), always in view; on the keyboard, `+` / `−` to speed up or slow down time, `Space` to pause.
- **How to use it?** (next to the title, or "Guided tour" in the welcome notice) starts a guided tour of the interface.
- The computers' buttons can be clicked, with a long press when the model has one. On mouse hover, a tooltip shows each button's real function during the dive (from the manufacturer's manual) and what is not simulated; buttons with no simulated function are greyed out.

- 🔇 / 🔊 (in the header) turns the computers' alarm sounds on or off (off by default, the choice is remembered). Each model sounds as its manual describes: beeps (Mares, Scubapro, Cressi, Aqualung), tones and vibration (Garmin, Suunto), vibration only for the Perdix 2 and the Peregrine TX. A vibration is played as a buzzing sound, shakes the computer on screen and, on phones that allow it (Android), really vibrates. Alarms that repeat until acknowledged stop when a button of the computer is pressed (SELECT on the Perdix 2, either button on the Peregrine TX). Each model's settings include its own switch (ALRM, All silent, Silent diving…).
- **Alerts**: each computer shows every alarm, warning and notification of its manual (text, colours, sounds, acknowledgement). Those set on the device (depth, time, NDL, CNS, tank pressure: reserve, half tank, turn pressure…) are under "Advanced settings › Alert settings", with the options and defaults of its manual. The advanced settings are sorted by theme: dive, algorithm and stops, alerts, sounds and vibration, display.
- **ⓘ Simulation details** (Settings tab) opens a dialog presenting the model: what is simulated from the manual, the values assumed or deduced when the manual does not give them, what is not simulated, and its configurable alerts with the values in use.

## Exercises

The **Exercises** tab offers situations to provoke and observe, for a student on their own: run out of no-deco time, ascend too fast, do the safety stop, do decompression stops, go above a stop, go past the gas's maximum depth, make a repetitive dive, switch to a deco gas (multi-gas computers only). Each exercise resets the dive and starts, paused, from a described situation (e.g. "at 25 m for 10 min"); the simulator checks the diver's state to tell whether it is passed. The debrief lists what the chosen computer signalled and when, and what its rules say (from its manual). Exercises are about behaviour (which signal, when, what follows), not about stop times, which are only approximated for proprietary algorithms. Passed exercises are remembered in the browser, per computer: doing one again with another model shows how differently they react.

## Several gases

The Settings tab lets the diver carry up to two decompression gases (nitrox from 40 to 80 % or pure oxygen), each in a stage tank (7 L, AL40 or AL80, filled before the dive). The gas is switched during the dive with the buttons of the computer shown, following the procedure of its manual (prompt at the gas MOD, menu or list of gases, confirmation); the gas breathed then changes for every computer compared, and it is drawn from its own tank. The deco gases are sorted by rising oxygen content (G2 below G3, as the Mares require); when a stage tank runs empty (or the diver switches back to it once empty), the diver goes back to the main tank, with a notice under the computer for 30 s and a note in the logbook, instead of raising the out-of-air rescue alert. The transmitter is on the main tank: the computers that tie a transmitter to each gas (Mares, Scubapro, Suunto D5 and Nautic, Garmin, Aqualung i770R) show no tank pressure on a deco gas, while the Shearwater and the Odyssey keep showing T1. Computers whose simulated mode holds several gases: Mares Quad Ci, Genius, Quad 2, Quad Air (3 gases) and Puck Pro (2); Scubapro G2 and Luna 2.0 AI (PMG option to enable); Suunto D5 (Multiple gases option to enable) and Nautic (Multigas mode, up to 5 gases, SWITCH GAS prompt); Aqualung i330R (3) and i770R (4); Azoth Systems Odyssey; Garmin Descent Mk3i (Single-Gas mode: backup gases, left out of the calculation until activated; Multi-Gas mode: decompression gases, "Safe to switch to…" prompt, Not Now / Never turning the gas into a backup gas); Shearwater Perdix 2 (3 GasNx mode, the default, up to 3 gases; OC Tec mode with its technical screen, up to 5 gases, GF 30/70, no safety stop) and Peregrine TX (3 GasNx mode, the default), with the Select Gas menu. Depending on the manual, the ascent time counts every gas carried (Quad Ci, Quad 2 and Genius in PREDICTIVE mode, G2 and Luna except a gas excluded after an unanswered prompt, D5, Nautic, Shearwater, Garmin in Multi-Gas mode except backup gases, the Odyssey's DTR) or only the gas breathed (Quad Air, as its manual states; Puck Pro, i330R and i770R, not stated by their manuals). Every multi-gas computer lets the diver switch back to the bottom gas from its menu or gas list. The Goa, the Donatello and the Zoop Novo hold a single gas in the simulated mode, like the Perdix 2 and the Peregrine TX in Nitrox mode. A computer that does not hold the gas breathed (single-gas model, or more gases carried than it holds) keeps the last gas programmed in it: its display, MOD, no-deco time and ascent plan use that gas, while the tissues stay the diver's (shared by every computer, a limit of the simulator). The "Switch to the deco gas" exercise is offered on the multi-gas computers; the others use a single gas.

## Surface, boat and repetitive dives

The tank is not refilled automatically between dives. Five seconds after surfacing during a dive (tank below 90 %), a boat comes alongside the diver and offers a full tank in a comic speech bubble, in both the 2D and 3D views. **Yes**: the diver climbs aboard, the dive ends and the tank is refilled; the next descent is a new dive. **No**: the boat leaves. After an ascent clearly too fast (average above 15 m/min over its last 10 m, the rescue alert's criterion, whatever the computer), the boat comes even with a full tank and first says the ascent was too fast and that the procedure from your training should be started. A dive is also closed after 3 minutes at the surface. Tissues stay loaded from one dive to the next; the logbook shows each dive's type: consecutive (surface interval under 15 min), repetitive (under 12 h) or single.

## MN90 tables

The **MN90** button (in the header, next to the computer list) opens, at any time, the French federal air tables (FFESSM tables based on the French Navy's MN90, July 2005 booklet) and shows where the diver stands in them (the dive is paused while it is open and resumes on closing), as a book whose pages are turned (◀ ▶ or the arrow keys): first the dive (type, depth, time, result), then each table used in the order it is read — Table I (previous dive's group × surface interval → residual nitrogen), Table II (residual nitrogen × depth of the second dive → penalty time) for a repetitive dive, then the depth's stop table (line → stops, DTR, group) — with the row, the column and the value read highlighted and the reading explained (next value up or down as the booklet requires). During the dive it shows the stops if the diver left the bottom now and when the next line is reached; at the surface, the last dive and the tables to read before diving again. Rules applied from the booklet: dive time counted until leaving the bottom, any minute started counts; an ascent slower than 15 m/min adds its time up to the first stop (slow ascent), so the time stops on reaching the first stop (the surface without stops); consecutive dives (under 15 min apart): times added, deepest depth; repetitive dives (15 min to 12 h): penalty time; nitrox: equivalent air depth; warnings for the emergency tables beyond 60 m, a previous dive without group (*), out of the tables, more than two dives in 24 hours, rapid ascent. Not simulated: the rapid-ascent and missed-stop procedures, pure-oxygen stops, Table III (oxygen at the surface), altitude. The Compare tab also has an MN90 row for the dive in progress: no-stop time left, first stop, DTR (in the TTS column) and group; a click opens the tables. A blank cell of Table I is read as no residual nitrogen left to count (the booklet does not say).

## 3D view

The **2D | 3D** button at the top of the dive area switches to a playful 3D view with three environments: coral reef (reef flat, slope down to the sand and coral heads), wreck (overgrown with corals) and wall (plateau and a wall dropping into the blue). The diver swims freely: drag horizontally, use the ◀ / ▶ arrow keys or the on-screen buttons to turn (full turns allowed), drag vertically to change the target depth. Right-click or Shift + drag to orbit the camera, double-click to recentre it. The seabed, the wreck, the rocks and the corals are solid: the diver swims along them instead of through them and rests on them when descending; they never lift the diver, so the depth profile stays entirely under the user's control. Rendering: caustics, light getting darker and bluer with depth (a torch takes over), Snell's window, swaying corals, seagrass and algae; at the surface the camera rises above the water: sky, swell with foam on the crests, the diver and the boat riding it. Sea life: schools of fish, a turtle, anemones whose clownfish hide when the diver comes close, starfish and sea urchins, pulsing jellyfish, gliding eagle rays and reef sharks keeping their distance. The simulation is the same in both views; three.js is only loaded the first time the 3D view is opened.
